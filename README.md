# T3X
The cuddly waffle toolset for T3 Raspberry Pi image creation & maintenance.

This tool augments the Alaska T3 program and the T3 Alliance Raspberry Pi (RPi) ecosystem by providing the `t3x` tool to assist in creating a standardized T3 Raspberry Pi platform.  The project has a few goals:
- Improve our ability to configure and harden the operating system and services used in T3 PIs.
- Ensure the ability to update and synchronize the recommended tools and configurations for T3 projects and RPi systems.
- Provide a platform for T3 RPi hackers to share and engage with neat tools and solutions to problems that evolve what we can do together.
- An interface to engaging with fun and silly things along with the serious stuff.

> [!note] 
> **Safe, Secure, Accessible & Fun:** The core mission of this project is to provide an interface that allows T3 learners to fortify the security and configuration of their devices, protecting them from potential cyber threats. It's not just about providing technology; it's about delivering safe and secure technology. Doing this should also be fun and adaptable to the evolving needs of the T3 community and their projects.

## Installation

Fully manual clone steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/uaf-t3/t3x
cd t3x
# Review the scripts starting with bootstrap.sh
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

Trust the T3X CHEESE lab team? Recommended easy method:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uaf-t3/t3x/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh | bash -e
```

### Changes/Impacts of installing `T3X`

- `.bashrc` will be setup to include `.bash.d/*.sh` scripts
- `.bash.d/00-t3x.sh` will setup `$HOME/t3x/bin` in user `PATH`
- `.bash.d/00-local.sh` will ensure `$HOME/.local/bin` is in user `PATH`
- `.bash.d/(other).sh` other scripts added for quality of life or when a user choosed to include/add a new feature that augments. 

Beyond that the impacts of T3X will depend on what tools from it you run.

## `t3x` Usage

The `t3x` command offers an interface to a collection of scripts and tools.

### Scripts

`t3x bootstrap` or `$HOME/t3x/scripts/bootstrap.sh` 
- Gets t3x installed & into a good state by the following steps:
- Verify functional access to the Internet
- Ensures basic tools needed for bootstrap (git) are available
- Fetches the latest version of the t3x `main` branch. 
- Setup `$HOME/.bash.d` folder.
- Use `.bash.d/00-t3x.sh` to ensure `$HOME/t3x/bin` is in `$PATH`

`t3x update`
- Attempt to update t3x using git

`t3x sanity`
- Tries to ensure all the tool dependancies for t3x are done
- This is done as part of bootstrap but can be run again later to ensure any new dependancies are available.

### Tools

#### `t3x pi` 
Tools to manage our pi.  Includes fun gems like:
- [ ] `t3x pi setup` (TODO)
  - [x] `t3x pi update`
  - [x] `t3x pi wallpaper`
- [x] `t3x pi lockdown`
  - [ ] runs setup (and steps involved there)
  - [x] `enable-wfw` installs and enables firewall
  - [x] `ssh-disable` stops and disables SSH
  - [x] `password-check` verifies default password not being used
  - [x] `vnc-disable` stops and disables VNC

#### `t3x starship`

A tool to ensure our T3 RPis have a cool custom prompt and fonts for maximum enjoyment.  See the [tools/starship/README.md](./tools/starship/README.md) for more details.  

`t3x starship setup`
- Installs & configures [starship.sh](https://starship.sh)
- Ensures the LxTerminal is using a NerdFont (required for advanced prompts)
- Future TODO include bash-completion and other advanced shells

`t3x starship launch`
- Bonus launch features
